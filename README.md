# Calendar App with Event Management

This is a **Calendar App** built using **React** and **Day.js**. It allows users to manage **resources** and **events**. Users can **add**, **delete**, and **resize** events dynamically, and events will span across the correct day boxes based on their **start** and **end times**.

## Features

- **Add Resources**: Add multiple resources to the calendar.
- **Add Events**: Add events with default times (e.g., 10 AM - 4 PM), and events span across one or more days.
- **Resize Events**: Drag or double-click the event edges to **grow** or **shrink** the event. The event will adjust its start and end times accordingly.
- **Delete Events and Resources**: Delete any events or resources that are no longer needed.
- **Calendar Navigation**: Navigate through months using **Previous** and **Next** buttons.
